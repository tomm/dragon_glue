Dragon Glue
===========

This is intended for people who want to:

 * Code by voice.
 * On X11.
 * Using Dragon Naturally Speaking.
 * Probably using VIM.

You will need to set up Dragon on a windows virtual machine, and SSH into
your X11 box (with putty or whatever), set up the DISPLAY variable and run
glue.py, then leave Dragon inputting text into your putty session.

run.sh shows you this sequence of commands.

i haven't attempted to add a large set of editor specific commands,
andHave instead added what is necessary for keyboard control via speech.
there are specific commands for entering identifiers for programming
languages.  for high accuracy and commanding vim the default mode
is to interpret all non-command words as being single keypresses
taking the first letter of the word as the intended  keypress.

Single keys:
============
utterance: Charlie India whiskey
keypresses: cia (vim: change word)

Identify entry:
===============
utterance: camel self dot parent of node
keypresses: self.parentOfNode

utterance: line self dot parent of node
keypresses: self.parent_of_node

You will have to read glue.py for the complete set of identifier entry
commands.
