Dragon Glue
===========

This is intended for people who want to:

 * Code by voice.
 * On X11.
 * Using Dragon Naturally Speaking.
 * Probably using VIM.

You will need to set up Dragon on a windows virtual machine, and SSH into
your X11 box (with putty or whatever), set up the DISPLAY variable and run
glue.py, then leave Dragon inputting text into your putty session.

run.sh shows you this sequence of commands.

i haven't attempted to add a large set of editor specific commands,
andHave instead added what is necessary for keyboard control via speech.
there are specific commands for entering identifiers for programming
languages.  for high accuracy and commanding vim the default mode
is to interpret all non-command words as being single keypresses
taking the first letter of the word as the intended  keypress.

Single keys:
============
utterance: Charlie India whiskey
keypresses: cia (vim: change word)

Identify entry:
===============
utterance: camel self dot parent of node equals single null
keypresses: self.parentOfNode = null

utterance: line self dot parent of node equals capital none
keypresses: self.parent_of_node = None

To suppress spaces around operators, and separators around identifiers use
'squeeze':

utterance: line self dot parent of node squeeze equals capital none
keypresses: self.parent_of_node=None

Squeeze also applies to identifiers:
utterance: keyword class capital my class open bracket squeeze base class close bracket
keypresses: class MyClass(baseclass)

utterance: squeeze self dot parent of node
keypresses: self.parentofnode

Complete list of identifier commands
====================================

spell           End identifier (re-enabling single character interpretation of words)
sequel          IDENTIFIERS LIKE THIS
capital         IdentifiersLikeThis
camel           identifiersLikeThis
line            identifiers_like_this
strike          identifiers-like-this
spacey          identifiers like this
squeeze         identifierslikethis
keyword         Single word with a space after it.
single          Single word without a space after it.

Character commands
==================
Shorthand for dragon's 'open square bracket' and 'close square bracket' are
'square' and 'unsquare' (the 2nd isn't a dictionary word and must be added
to dragon by you).

Other commands
==============
You will have to read glue.py for the complete list of commands.
