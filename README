Dragon Glue
===========

This is intended for people who want to:

 * Code by voice.
 * On X11.
 * Using Dragon Naturally Speaking.
 * Probably using VIM.

You will need to set up Dragon on a windows virtual machine, and SSH into
your X11 box (with putty or whatever), set up the DISPLAY variable and run
glue.py, then leave Dragon inputting text into your putty session.

run.sh shows you this sequence of commands.

i haven't attempted to add a large set of editor specific commands,
andHave instead added what is necessary for keyboard control via speech.
there are specific commands for entering identifiers for programming
languages.  for high accuracy and commanding vim the default mode
is to interpret all non-command words as being single keypresses
taking the first letter of the word as the intended  keypress.

Single keys:
============

This is the default identifier input mode. If you are in another mode you can
enter this mode with the command: spell

utterance: Charlie India whiskey
keypresses: cia (vim: change word)

utterance: capital my scary spell big alpha big papa big india
keypresses: MyScaryAPI

Identify entry:
===============
utterance: camel self dot parent of node equals single null
keypresses: self.parentOfNode = null

utterance: line self dot parent of node equals capital none
keypresses: self.parent_of_node = None

To capitalize a single word use the command 'big':
utterance: line self dot parent of big node equals capital none
keypresses: self.parent_of_Node = None

To suppress spaces around operators, and separators around identifiers use
'squeeze':

utterance: line self dot parent of node squeeze equals capital none
keypresses: self.parent_of_node=None

Squeeze also applies to identifiers:
utterance: keyword class capital my class open bracket squeeze base class close bracket
keypresses: class MyClass(baseclass)

utterance: squeeze self dot parent of node
keypresses: self.parentofnode

Escaping Command Words
======================

If you want to enter: capitalCityOfScotland
You must say: capital literal capital city of scotland

Without the 'literal', capital will be assumed to be a (start identifier)
command.

This escaping works for all commands and expansions that are not actually
dragon naturally speaking commands.

Complete list of identifier commands
====================================

spell           End identifier (re-enabling single character interpretation of words)
sequel          IDENTIFIERS LIKE THIS
capital         IdentifiersLikeThis
camel           identifiersLikeThis
line            identifiers_like_this
strike          identifiers-like-this
spacey          identifiers like this
squeeze         identifierslikethis
keyword         Single word with a space after it.
single          Single word without a space after it.
dictate		Enter normal english text (exactly as dragon receives it).

Identifer mode returns to 'spell' after 'newline' or 'escape' commands.

Custom words to add to dragon's vocabulary
==========================================

unangle		- Short for 'close angle bracket'
unsquare	- Short for 'close square bracket'
unbracket	- Short for 'close bracket'

Other commands
==============
You will have to read glue.py for the complete list of commands.
